                        <p className="py-2 px-4 flex-initial w-100 text-justify text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg">Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am a software engineer who spent 20 years in the material handling industry. I spent the first decade of my time there traveling the country bringing multi-million-dollar distribution centers to life. During my second decade in that industry, I moved into R&D and support roles and had the opportunity to learn new software technologies for various products that I worked on.</p>

                        <p className="py-2 px-4 flex-initial w-100 text-justify text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg">My various roles within the material handling industry helped me to develop many skills. I understand the importance of meeting customersâ€™ needs on time and on budget. I worked within numerous agile and non-agile development and cross-functional teams to bring conveyor systems online and to produce new software products. I worked on software across a variety of applications, including conveyor control systems, user interfaces, host communication systems, and database systems.</p>

                        <p className="py-2 px-4 flex-initial w-100 text-justify text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg">In 2018, I decided to leave the material handling industry. I spent several years learning the ins and outs of forex (FX) trading. I worked on MQL4 algorithms to look for the ideal entry and exit points for trades. I enjoyed spending a few years applying my logic and software skills in a new arena, but at the same time, I felt I wanted to do more with my skills.</p>

                        <p className="py-2 px-4 flex-initial w-100 text-justify text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg">In 2021, I began the journey into web development. I delved into new software languages, frameworks, and database systems. In 2022, I decided to join a software bootcamp. In March of 2023, I completed the Nucamp Full Stack Web and App Development bootcamp with a Certificate of Honor.</p>

                        <p className="py-2 px-4 flex-initial w-100 text-justify text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg">Over the course of my career, I have developed a wealth of knowledge across many facets of the software development industry.
